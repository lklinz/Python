    "## Rules of Tấn (Durak):\n",
    "Tấn (also known as Durak) is a Vietnamese card game, containing 2 to 4 players (in this game:2). At the beginning of the game, one of the players becomes the dealer and deals 8 cards to each player. A trump suit is then selected by pulling a random card from the deck and placing it face up on the table. (The trump suit can be used to defend against all other suits regardless of the power of the attacking cards. When using a triumph suit card to defend another triumph suit card, the player needs to follow the normal rules of the game). The remaining cards are then placed on the trump card, face down, leaving the suit of the trump visible.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Each player takes turns to attack the player next to them (the first attacker chooses whether the game goes clockwise or counter clockwise). The attacked player then becomes the defender. After the attacker finishes their attack, any non-defending players can then choose to attack. The defender will continue to defend until either the attackers give up or the defender folds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The defender defends attacks by defending with a higher card of the attacking suit, or any card of the trump suit if applicable. If the defending player was successful, all played cards are removed from play. If the defender cannot defend or chooses not to, they are required to add all played cards to their hand. After a round terminates, the first attacker draws till they have 8 cards in their hand, at which point the next attacker draws till 8. This continues until all attackers have drawn till 8 or until the deck runs out of cards.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The winner can be determined when: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The defender wins if the deck has no remaining cards and the defender successfully defends until they have no remaining cards.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* If there are still cards remaining in the deck and the defender runs out of cards, but the attackers are unable to continue attacking, the defender wins.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the attackers can continue attacking and then the defender must draw to 8 to continue defending.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If a winner has been determined, the game will continue until there is only a single player with cards in their hand.  "

    "In version 0, we had to print an empty board to visualize the game. We figured since this was a card game, typically played on a table, we should print a large amount empty space to replicate a table. We also wanted the player to be capable of visualizing the cards in their hand, and we had already discussed using a list as a method of adding and removing cards from a player's hand (popping off cards and appending them). Therefore, we assigned the variable 'Playerhand' to an empty string for use in the game. The emptyBoardTable function uses an f-string to print the list representing the player's hand towards the bottom of the board, closer to the player, where one might keep their hand."

    "After printing an empty board, we had to add a number of features such as dealing cards, making an additional player hand as this would be a two-player game, and adding two dictionaries, a value dictionary and a suit dictionary, for the purposes of extracting numerical values and suits from the cards we would be using in the game. We first decided to add the dealing feature by importing the random module so we could later shuffle our deck of cards. We then assigned the turns variable for later being able to determine turns for conditional statements, we added the cardsPlayed variable to alternate between the hands visible on the print board with a conditional statement, and we added two lists, attacking and defending cards. This allowed us to make the visual aspect of the game much more user friendly, as it would only display one player's hand at a time, and would alternate between the attacker and the defender. The attacking cards and defending cards would also be displayed as they were lists which appended the played cards from each player's hand. This would allow the attacker to visually see what available moves they had as the attacker, after the first turn, can only attack using cards with the same values as the attacker or defender hands and would allow the defender to see what cards they were defending against. We also used a for-loop to \"deal\" out the cards from the deck into the hands of each player.  "

    "The trumpsuit initially extracted the value at the index 1, by taking a card and separating each part of it into indicies for a list. Ex. AC,(Ace of Clubs), was added to the empty list TrumpSuit as [A,C], so the 'Suit' was extracted by reading the letter of the corresponding suit directly following the card number (in the second index position), and running said value through our suits dictionary, in this case clubs. However, when any card had a value of 10, the list read something like this [1,0,Suit], so instead of extracting the suit, it extracted the number 0. For this reason, an elif statement was created to resolve this problem by writing a conditional if statement to determine if the strings ('10S','10C','10H','10D') were present in the trump suit. If this was the case, the trump suit would instead return the value at the third index [2] instead of the second [1], which would return the suit. The value of each card was determined by taking the first index, [0], from each card listed as a string, and then used as a key for the value dictionary to return an integer. For this reason, 10, which reads as a '1' and was worth 10 points. "

    "After establishing the framework for the visual aspect for the game, we then had to actually create the game. Being a card game with many rules, this step required implementing numerous conditional statements simply to make the game playable. The goal of this step was to create a single turn of the game. We determined the attacker and defender using the number of turns to track which player was the attacker and which was the defender by alternating between even and odd numbered turns. The restrictions on what cards the attacker was capable of playing were also implemented, (i.e. in Durak, the rules prevent the attacker from attacking with any value card other than the ones already on the table after the first turn) as were the restrictions on what would be a valid defensive card. We also added the variables attackCard and defendCard to allow for more mutability. The attackCard is assigned to the input of the attacker, removed from their hand, and appended to the list of attacking cards. This same process is followed for the defendCard variable. The cardsPlayed integer was used to alternate the boards as each time a valid card was played, the variable was incremented by 1. At this point, the only major problem with gameplay was that players were unable to quit if they had chosen to attack despite not having a valid attack card or if they had chosen to defend despite not having a valid defend card.

    "After implementing most of the rules of the game, we had to add code to make the game continue past one turn. We added a function called nextAttackingTurn, which, in the event of a defender quitting, cleared the table, appended the cards from the table to the defender's hand, and dealt out cards with the Draw function to ensure both players had 8 cards in their hand. The Draw function was something also created in this step because the rules of Durak dictate each player must always have 8 cards in their hand as long as the deck still has cards to draw from. We also added a while loop to allow a sequence of turns to make the game continue so we can determine a winner in a later step. The cardsPlayed variable was renamed to the move variable for readability. The global variables were also changed to be tuples returned from the functions. "

    "For this checkpoint, we finally decided to incorporate a visual aspect to the cards to allow the player to have a better representation of what was in their hand. We also added color to the Hearts and Diamonds by adding it to the beginning and end of each line of code for the Heart and Diamonds cards, which allowed for more easy readability for the player. We also created a dictionary called visual which would convert the strings of the deck and hands to the lists for visual printing of the cards. We also created the functions printhand, determinewinner, and fixed our while-loop to end when a winner has been determined. The determinewinner function checks after every card is played to see if a winner has been found. We also imported subprocess to clear the board after every move to prevent the game from continuously printing the board. The colorama module was also imported for the aforementioned color. "

We created the function visualForCards which read the text file and created the dictionary 'visual' which we had hard-coded in the previous version, and this function also added color as the dictionary was created. We also added a while-loop which allowed the user to quit after each game had been completed (a winner had been determined), or at the beginning of the first game. The Draw function was also changed to only remove the cards which had been appended to the player's hand as previously it was removing excess cards. "
